# Autonomous_driving

The autonomous car driving simulation is a browser-based project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a self-driving car with real-time sensor data processing, neural network-based decision-making, and a dynamic road environment. The project includes modules for car movement, sensor detection, AI learning, and visualization, enabling fine-tuning of driving behavior. This simulation demonstrates AI-driven autonomous navigation in a controlled virtual setting. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

Steps for running the code-

1)Open main.js, Go live 
2)Refresh the screen a couple of times(around 20) one by one after short intervals of time until the car finds its optimum position 
3)Save the progress using the save button and delete the progress using "Bin" icon
